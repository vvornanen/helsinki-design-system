A 1px increment has long held the standard in digital and an increment of 2px–8px has been adopted more recently. Icons sit snugly on their 24 x 24px system icon grid, using 1px–2px strokes. Pixel-snapping helps you render sharper icons on lower resolution screens but has become much less of a requirement as hardware rendering has improved.\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"icon-grid\"\n    }}>{`Icon grid`}</h2>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\"><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Example: Variations of common icon grids.`}</strong></p>\n      <Image src=\"../../static/assets/image/icongrid@2x.jpg\" alt=\"A simple icon grid for making icons.\" style={{\n        \"maxWidth\": \"600px\"\n      }} viewable mdxType=\"Image\" />\nAn icon grid is a tool for speed and consistency.
